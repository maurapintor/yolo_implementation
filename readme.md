# YOLO v1 tutorial

This is a module of the "Deep Learning and Computer Vision" course: https://unica-ml.github.io/dlcv/


## Instructions

1. Prepare the environment (I personally recommend miniconda). Install all required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements`
2. Download the dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/734b7bcb7ef13a045cbdd007a3c19874c2586ed0b02b4afc86126e89d00af8d2 and place it in the folder `data`.
3. Train the model by using the `train.py` script, or download the model from [here](https://github.com/maurapintor/yolo_implementation/releases/download/v1.0/model.pth).
4. Test the model by predicting some bounding boxes by using the `predict.py` script.
